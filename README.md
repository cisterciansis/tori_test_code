# Tori's Test Code!
test code to learn variables and functions

Imagine you have a few magic boxes and recipes in your computer:

- **Variables are like labeled boxes.**  
  When you write something like:
  ```python
  name = "Alice"
  ```
  you’re putting the word "Alice" into a box labeled **name**. Later, if you change it to:
  ```python
  name = "Bob"
  ```
  you're just updating that box with a new value. You can store numbers, text (called strings), and more in these boxes.

- **Strings are simply text.**  
  They are any characters inside quotes, like `"Hello, world!"` or `"Learning Python is fun!"`. They let you work with words and sentences in your code.

- **Functions are like recipes.**  
  Think of a function as a set of instructions you write down once, and then you can follow it anytime. For example:
  ```python
  def greet(person_name):
      print("Hello " + person_name + "! Welcome to the Python playground!")
  ```
  This recipe (function) takes an ingredient (called a parameter) — in this case, a person's name — and then prints a welcome message. To use this recipe, you “call” the function:
  ```python
  greet("Alice")
  ```
  which will display a friendly greeting.

In the playground code provided:
- Each section is explained with comments (lines starting with `#`).
- You can run the code, see the output, and even change values or add new functions.
- Experimenting with the code helps you see how variables and functions work together.
